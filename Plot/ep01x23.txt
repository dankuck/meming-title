[Interior darkened warehouse]
Robin: Why did Batman want to meet us here?
Jesus: I honestly don't know.

[Batman's silohette]
Batman: I learned it by watching you.

[trio view]
Noid: That's omenous.
Jesus: Not really the kind of thing you start with when you're revealing a big secret about the science of memes.

[Another Batman silhouette]
Batman: It's the key to memes. But it doesn't matter.

[Batman head on]
Batman: Because I'm not giving it to you.

[trio view]
Jesus: Well, actually you just told it to us.

[Batman shadows again]
Batman: I learned a lot from both of you. You Noid.

[Noid view]
Batman: You're not actively evil. You're just selfish. You don't go out of your way to make the world worse.

[Monsters flashback]
Batman: You just don't care enough to stop it.

[Noid view]
Noid: That's fair.

[Jesus view]
Batman: But you Jesus.

[Batman silhouette]
Batman: Or should I say Jesus meme?

[Some Jesus memes]
Batman: Because you're not the real Jesus. 

[Batman silhouette]
Batman: You're just the meme. Like all of us, you're the idea of Jesus.

[Jesus memes]
Batman: But you're completely broken. You have borderline personality disorder. People never agree on you.

[Batman silhouette]
Batman: And you don't care. You only want power. You want to spread and lord it over everyone. You don't care about anything.

[Jesus washing feet]
Batman: But Jesus was a servant. He cared about people.

[Jesus character view]
Batman: Hell, I'm more like Jesus than you.

[Batman looking pensive]

[Jesus view]
Jesus: You wish. I made you! I gave you life. When I found you, you were a mindless meme like the rest of them.

[Batman silhouette over jesus view]
Batman: Yes, that's it. I'm more like Jesus than you.

[Batman JESUS!]
Batman: I AM the new Jesus!

[Jesus view]
Jesus: You're mad! But that does remind me of me when I was a younger meme.

[Batman Jesus View]
Batman: You brought me to life because you needed me, but I don't need you.

[Batman view]
Robin: NO!

[Robin view]
Robin: Batman, no...
