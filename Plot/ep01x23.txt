PART 1

[1. Interior darkened warehouse]
Robin: Why did Batman want to meet us here?
Jesus: I honestly don't know.

[2. Batman's silohette]
Batman: I learned it by watching you.

[3. trio view]
Noid: That's omenous.
Jesus: Not really the kind of thing you start with when you're revealing a big secret about the science of memes.

[4. Another Batman silhouette]
Batman: It's the key to memes. But that doesn't matter.

[5. Batman head on]
Batman: Because I'm not giving it to you.

[6. trio view]
Jesus: Well, actually you just told us it's "by watching you".

[7. Batman shadows again]
Batman: I learned a lot from both of you. You Noid.

[8. Noid view]

[12. Batman silhouette]
Batman: Or should I say Jesus meme?

[13. Some Jesus memes]

[14. Batman silhouette]
Batman: You're just the meme. Like all of us, you're the idea of Jesus.

[15. Jesus memes]
Batman: But you're completely broken. You have borderline personality disorder. People never agree on you.

[16. Batman silhouette]
Batman: And you don't care. You only want power. You want to spread and lord it over everyone. You don't care about anything.

[17. Jesus washing feet]

[18. Jesus character view]
Batman: Hell, I'm more like Jesus than you.

[19. Batman looking pensive]

[21. Batman silhouette over jesus view]
Batman: No, that's it. I'm more like Jesus than you.

[22. Batman JESUS!]

[23. Jesus view]

[24. Batman Jesus View]
